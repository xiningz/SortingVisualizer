# SortingVisualizer

This project is a web application built using React and JavaScript, it provides an interactive and educational way for users to learn about sorting algorithms and how they work.

Users can generate a random array of numbers and select a sorting algorithm (bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort) to apply to the array. The application then visualizes the sorting process by rendering a set of bars, each representing a number in the array. The bars change color as they are sorted, giving a clear indication of which bars are already sorted and which ones are still being sorted.
